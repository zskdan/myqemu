For Debugging Linux Kernel with qemu we must follow this steps :
- Recompile kernel with support of kgdb, in submenu of Kernel Hacking.
- make bzImage
- transfering the new kernel image to the target
- appending "kgdbwait" to kernel options.
- starting qemu with options : 
	* -s for attaching a gdbserver on tcp port 1234 
	* -S for freezing qemu until we will be ready.
- starting gdb with :
	gdb ./vmlinux
 	b start_kernel
	target remote tcp:localhost:1234
